# README
A personal communication guide to share my working style and preferences 

## What are your primary goals as a human being?
- Authenticity: I am sincere in all I do, my goal being to have an authentic life experience. I love that Netlify encourages us to bring our whole selves to work. I am recovering from needing to have a “work persona”. It sucked.
- Learning: I question everything and push myself outside of my comfort zone, so I can learn and grow. 
- Helping: I love to help others succeed and find fulfillment. I love to make things easier for people.

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?
- I am generally most comfortable and communicative in 1:1s and small group settings. The larger the group the more my natural introversion becomes apparent.
- Because I am on the quiet side, I worry that people think I am not engaged. But I like to carefully consider my words before speaking, and only comment when I feel it would add to the discussion. Sometimes I have trouble articulating what I want to say in the moment. Sometimes I need to collect my thoughts first then speak.
- I sometimes follow a thought down a path that may not be the most helpful to the problem at hand. I like to consider all paths forward, but please reign me in if I stray too far off a productive path.
- I have a hard time delegating work/telling people what to do.
- I prioritize kindness in all communications.

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
- I am not a morning person. I like to spend my mornings very quietly, alone, reading and setting my intentions for the day. 
- I do my best coding at night.
- I value cooperation and understanding over perfectionism. 
- I strive for team harmony. I see inefficiencies in everything, everywhere I go, but find that nitpicking little inefficiencies to be counterproductive to team morale.
- I take a lot of notes and am a guilt-ridden tree killer.
- I love a checklist.

## How can you best work with me?
- Make it very clear who is responsible for what (via action items, etc.).
- Feedback: I have no ego and a very thick skin, and believe that well-meaning, well-delivered criticism can only help me get better at my job. The only request I have is that a particularly negative feedback is delivered privately if possible.
- There are no dumb questions.

## What are your pet peeves?
- Flaking: If you say you are going to do something, please honor your word. 
- Meetings that could have been an email.
- Not having a clear strategy/purpose/plan.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
- Self-confidence is an ongoing challenge. I am working on it!
- Technical skills. Eager to learn, anxious that I am not doing it fast enough.
